                                <p>Wineries across California have been suffering due to rising temperatures, from the growing of the grapes to the tasting of the wines. Temperatures across the state have been consistently high, with many of the popular wine regions hovering around the high 90's to low 100's. </p>

                                <p>In our own Paso Robles wine region, temperatures have been frequently hitting the mid 100's, which has had an impact on the local wine industry. Tasting rooms in Tin City have had to accommodate for the unbearable temperatures in an attempt to make guests comfortable, such as moving their outdoor tastings to their indoor production spaces.</p>

                                </figure>

                                <p>Several wineries have reported significant decreases in their foot traffic, which has led to a decline in overall profit; tasting rooms bring in the majority of many small wineries' income and attention, and low foot traffic hurts the businesses in both the short and long term. Tin City as a whole, which includes over two dozen wineries and five restaurants, has reported 67% less foot traffic this Summer compared to last Summer.</p>

                                <p>Several factors may play a role in the declining numbers aside from the heat, including COVID-19 and the economy. Because COVID-19 restrictions have eased up significantly this Summer compared to last Summer, tourists are more inclined to travel and attend to other attractions. And with the heat, they are less likely to visit a hot region and sit outside for a wine tasting while they could be elsewhere, such as indoors or at the beach. Gas prices have also skyrocketed due complex global factors and nation-wide inflation, and California residents are less motivated to drive up to wine taste.</p>

                                <p>While in-person traffic has slowed in Tin City, wineries have begun to see an increase in online orders; however, these issues have had a major impact on US shipping services, and the industry has taken a hit because of this. Major wine shipping services such as GSO, FedEx, and UPS have all reported supply chain issues, weather delays, and understaffing resulting in lost packages and slower than ideal delivery times.</p>

                                <p>Despite facing difficulties now wineries are optimistic that Fall harvest– which is just around the corner– will go smoothly. Heat can be really damaging to grapevines and the grapes needed to make the wine, and the hot temperatures are slightly concerning to many of Tin  City's head wine makers. However, they are hopeful, especially as the state has sseen less fires than past years and smoke will not be a major toxin affecting this year's harvest. • </p>
