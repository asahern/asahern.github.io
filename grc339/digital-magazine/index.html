                                <p>
                                    Wineries across Tin City have been experiencing significant revenue loss due to the rising temperatures this Summer. Paso Robles is expected to hit over 100º this weekend, and tasting rooms are anticipating low foot traffic. Tin City, a business district in Paso Robles, California, is home to over two dozen wineries. The region requently experiences over 100º heat waves that have had detrimental affects on the industry, from tourism to crop harvesting.
